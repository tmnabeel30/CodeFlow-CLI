# CodeFlow CLI

A powerful, terminal-first AI coding assistant with **advanced agentic capabilities**. CodeFlow helps you read, explore, analyze, and improve your codebase with an enhanced chat UI, intelligent tools, and safe, confirmed edits.

## üöÄ Why CodeFlow?

- **Advanced Agent Mode**: Enhanced AI capabilities with intelligent tool orchestration
- **Stunning terminal UI** with rich colors, syntax-highlighting, and interactive panels
- **Three powerful modes** that fit any workflow:
  - **Q&A Mode** (read-only): Ask questions about the codebase without making changes
  - **Agent Mode** (write): Propose and apply changes with diff previews and confirmation  
  - **Advanced Agent** (enhanced): Smart tools, semantic search, code analysis, and intelligent automation
- **Smart codebase understanding**: Automatic project structure analysis and context awareness
- **Semantic search capabilities**: Find code by meaning, not just text matching
- **Advanced code analysis**: Structure analysis, complexity metrics, and issue detection
- **Tool execution tracking**: Monitor and manage all AI operations with full transparency
- **Enhanced file operations**: Read, edit, create, and delete files with intelligent assistance
- **Real-time collaboration**: Switch between modes seamlessly during chat sessions

## Install

```bash
pip install codeflow-cli
```

## Quick Start

```bash
codeflow
```

On start, pick a mode:
- **Q&A Mode** (`1` or `qna`) - Read-only questions about your codebase
- **Agent Mode** (`2` or `agent`) - Propose/apply improvements with confirmation
- **Advanced Agent** (`3` or `advanced`) - Enhanced AI with smart tools and analysis

Switch modes anytime during chat:
- `/qna` - Switch to Q&A mode
- `/agent` - Switch to Agent mode
- `/mode <mode_name>` - Switch to specified mode

## Configuration

Set your Groq API key one of the following ways:

```bash
# Recommended: environment variable
export GROQ_API_KEY="your-groq-api-key"

# Or interactively
codeflow configure

# Or via flag
codeflow --api-key "your-groq-api-key"
```

## üìö Examples

### Q&A Mode (Read-Only Analysis)
```bash
# Start CodeFlow and select Q&A mode
codeflow
> Select mode: 1 (Q&A Mode)

# Ask questions about your codebase
You: Where is the CLI entry point defined?
AI: The CLI entry point is defined in `groq_agent/cli.py`...

# Read and preview files
/read groq_agent/cli.py
```

### Agent Mode (File Modifications)
```bash
# Switch to Agent mode
/agent

# Propose edits with diff preview
# Edit multiple files with shared context
/edit groq_agent/enhanced_chat.py groq_agent/agentic_chat.py
What changes? Improve the prompt styling and add a bottom toolbar.
# Shows diff, asks for confirmation before applying
```

### üöÄ Advanced Agent Mode
```bash
# Start with Advanced Agent mode
codeflow
> Select mode: 3 (Advanced Agent)

# Semantic search across codebase
/search "user authentication logic"
# Finds relevant code by meaning, not just keywords

# Analyze code structure and quality
/analyze groq_agent/api_client.py
# Shows metrics: complexity, structure, potential issues

# Get comprehensive system status
/status
# Shows workspace info, recent changes, tool usage

# Intelligent file editing
/edit src/main.py tests/test_main.py
What changes? Add error handling for API calls and update tests accordingly
# AI understands context and proposes intelligent changes
```

### Quick Model Switching
```bash
# Quick switches during any mode
/fast      # Switch to fastest model
/powerful  # Switch to most capable model
/next      # Cycle to next model
/shortcuts # Show all quick commands
```

## Uninstall

```bash
pip uninstall codeflow-cli
```
